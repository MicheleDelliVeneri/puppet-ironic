features:
  - |
    The ``to_project_uuid`` transformer now load credentials from the clouds
    yaml file. In case the file is not available then it tries to load
    credential in openrc file or environment variables like the previous
    version.

deprecations:
  - |
    Usage of ``ironic_config`` with ``transform_to => project_uuid`` has been
    undeprecated.

  - |
    The ``ironic::glance::swift_account_project_name`` parameter is no longer
    deprecated.
