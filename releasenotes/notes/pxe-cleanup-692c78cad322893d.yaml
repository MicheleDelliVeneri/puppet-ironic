features:
  - Adds support for the ``ironic.conf`` parameters ``[pxe]ipxe_bootfile_name``
    and ``[pxe]ipxe_config_template`` which are utilized by the ``ipxe`` boot
    interface in Ironic. These settings use the manifest parameters
    ``ironic::drivers::pxe::ipxe_bootfile_name`` and
    ``ironic::drivers::pxe::ipxe_config_template`` respectively.
  - Adds support for the ``ironic.conf`` parameter
    ``[pxe]uefi_ipxe_bootfile_name`` to be explicitly set using the
    ``ironic::drivers::pxe::uefi_ipxe_bootfile_name`` manifest parameter,
    however this value is defaulted to ``snponly.efi`` which is anticipated
    to become the default in Ironic sometime in the Xena development cycle.
upgrade:
  - |
    The Ironic project has in elevated support for ``ipxe`` to a top level
    node boot_interface, and removed support for it's ``[pxe]ipxe_enabled``
    option as this is settable per node. Removal of this option has allowed
    for the manifest to be cleaned up.
  - The manifest now no longer applies override defaults for a number of
    ``ironic.conf`` settings, as they match the default settings the project
    utilizes. These manifest parameters are
    ``ironic::drivers::pxe::pxe_bootfile_name``,
    ``ironic::drivers::pxe::pxe_config_template``,
    ``ironic::drivers::pxe::tftp_root``,
    ``ironic::drivers::pxe::tftp_master_path``.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``ironic::drivers::pxe::ipxe_enabled`` parameter has been deprecated
    and has no effect moving forward. This is a result of the underlying
    Ironic project deprecating and removing. Use of this option will raise
    a warning.
  - The ``ironic::drivers::pxe::ip_version`` parameter has been deprecated
    for removal. Please anticipate this option to be removed in a future
    release. This option has been redundant since the Ussuri release of
    Ironic. Use of this option raises a warning.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes a potential issue where use of the
    ``ironic::drivers::pxe::ipxe_enabled`` parameter would
    cause settings specific to ``ipxe`` to be set overriding the ``pxe`` boot
    interface's defaults in Ironic. This resulted in operators being unable to
    choose to boot a node from ``pxe`` and not ``ipxe``. Now the settings are
    not overriden as the ``ironic::drivers::pxe::ipxe_enabled`` parameter for
    the manifest has no effect, and raises a warning if used.
