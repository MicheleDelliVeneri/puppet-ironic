    In order to allow the ironic inspector dnsmasq service to receive packets
    after the network service is restarted, the bind-interfaces option should
    not be set.  Since the ironic inspector is bound to the br-ctlplane
    interface, its not necessary to set this field as this dnsmasq instance
    will only service this interface.

    From the `dnsmasq man page
    <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html>`_:

        -z, --bind-interfaces
        On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address, even
        when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then discards requests
        that it shouldn't reply to. This has the advantage of working even when
        interfaces come and go and change address. This option forces dnsmasq
        to really bind only the interfaces it is listening on. About the only
        time when this is useful is when running another nameserver (or another
        instance of dnsmasq) on the same machine. Setting this option also
        enables multiple instances of dnsmasq which provide DHCP service to run
        in the same machine.

    We do run another dnsmasq instance for neutron but that is bound to the tap
    interface in the namespace.
