    For baremetal operations on DHCPv6-stateful networks multiple IPv6 addresses
    can now be allocated for neutron ports created for provisioning, cleaning,
    rescue or inspection. The new parameter
    ``ironic::neutron::dhcpv6_stateful_address_count`` controls the number of
    addresses to allocate.
