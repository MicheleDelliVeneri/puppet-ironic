upgrade:
  - |
    An explict ironic ``enabled_hardware_types`` setting has been removed
    from ``puppet-ironic`` as it matches the Ironic default and the default
    override prohibits inclusion of additional default enabled hardware types
    the OpenStack Ironic project may choose to ship in the future.
