    Deprecates integration for Ironic's Bifrost sub-project.
    
    Bifrost serves a similar purpose as puppet-ironic, in so much as the
    embedded configuration lags behind and ultimately is no longer appropriate
    for a bifrost deployment. If you wish to deploy bifrost, please make use of
    the bifrost-cli tool or Ansible playbooks noted in
    `Bifrost's documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/bifrost/latest/>`_.
