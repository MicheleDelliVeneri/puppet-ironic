    The new ``ironic::pxe::tftp_use_xinetd`` parameter has been added. When
    this parameter is set to ``false``, the ironic-dnsmasq-tftp-server service,
    which actually manages a dnsmasq process, is used instead of xinetd, to
    implement TFTP server. Note that the dnsmasq service is currently available
    only in RDO.
