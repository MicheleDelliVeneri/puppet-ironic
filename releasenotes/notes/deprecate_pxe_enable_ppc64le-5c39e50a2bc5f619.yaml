    The boolean parameter ``ironic::pxe::enable_ppc64le`` is now undefined and
    setting it has no effect. Previously, setting it to true resulted in the
    creation of ``/tftpboot/ppc64le/``. This directory is only required for the
    creation of inspector file ``/tftpboot/ppc64le/default``. For this reason
    the directory creation is moved to ``inspector.pp`` and both are created
    when ``ironic::inspector::enable_ppc64le`` is set to ``true``.
